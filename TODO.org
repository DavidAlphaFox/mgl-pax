* MAYBE add locatives for sbcl deftransform, defoptimizer, define-vop, define-source-transfrom
* TODO export documentation generation utilities for extensions
* OPT esrap is slow with allegro cl
* MAYBE todo/comment locative?
* defining link ids doesn't work in function docstrings
because it's translated to a list item
* TODO pretty print lambda-lists (including default values)
and values of variables. Unfortunately, there seems to be no way to
use the lisp pretty printer for this because output also includes
markup.
* MAYBE transcribe: emacs retranscribe should not update if consistent?
This either relies on the global value of
*TRANSCRIBE-CHECK-CONSISTENCY* or it needs to see the
"```cl-transcript (...)" line.
* MAYBE support external links
There are two kinds:
- object is text (like the CLHS locative)
- normal references with external urls (hyperspec symbol lookup)

The first kind is needs no additional support from pax as markdown
reference links or user defined locatives can take care of this case.

The second kind is very easy to implement: it only needs a small
change in INITIALIZE-LINKS.
* MAYBE link to MOP
* warn on linking failure
How to recoginize normal reference links? Don't, just warn on any
linking failure. This should be in 3BMD.
* break test-document into smaller tests
* consider CommonDoc from the 40ants fork
* MAYBE split transcription off into a separate library?
* linkify and codify in one map-markdown-parse-tree?
* no autolinking if any explicit linking was done previously?
* MAYBE allow lowercase only in the last "word" of the name
* *document-downcase-uppercase-code* is still broken
- Not everything in backticks is lisp code.
- `(PRINT "hello")` is not getting downcased.
* downcase objects and arglists?
* describe-object or document-object?
* remove some markup in :PLAIN format?
* allow markdown in titles?
* document depluralization
* link in method docstring is to itself?!

- [method] **TEST-GF** *(X NUMBER)*

    [`TEST-GF`][ba01] links to the generic function. `X` is not a link.

* in html add a slight background color to inline code?
* add symbol as an alias for dislocated?
* uppercase SLIME, link to it
