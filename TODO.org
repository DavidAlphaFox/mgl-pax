* TODO add METHOD-COMBINATION locative
* TODO export documentation generation utilities for extensions
* OPT esrap is slow with allegro cl
* MAYBE link to doc instead of including it if it is referenced multiple times?
Which one is the master? Heuristically, the references from sections
in the same package are to be preferred.
* MAYBE todo/comment locative?
* defining link ids doesn't work in function docstrings
because it's translated to a list item
* MAYBE autolink to the hyperspec?
* MAYBE port the hyperspec to pax
Copyright on lispworks' version is restrictive, allegro?
* MAYBE fake/override documentation for existing stuff
* TODO pretty print lambda-lists (including default values)
and values of variables. Unfortunately, there seems to be no way to
use the lisp pretty printer for this because output also includes
markup.
* MAYBE add [link name][(FOO VARIABLE)] kind of link
Maybe with a retitling-locative? [FOO][(RETITLE "link name" VARIABLE)])
* *DOCUMENT-DOWNCASE-UPPERCASE-CODE* with noninterned stuff is a bit broken
Noninterned stuff is not downcased, which leads to having to mix
casing up in the docstring.
* MAYBE include signalled errors in transcript?
* MAYBE transcribe: add inline commands that can change prefixes and such
* MAYBE transcribe: special comment syntax for the 'narrative'
to produce something like an ipython notebook.
