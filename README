## MGL-PAX ASDF System Details

- Version: 0.0.4
- Description: Exploratory programming tool and documentation
  generator.
- Long Description: The set of dependencies of the MGL-PAX system is
  kept light, and its heavier dependencies are autoloaded via ASDF
  when the relavant functionality is accessed. See the
  MGL-PAX/NAVIGATE, MGL-PAX/DOCUMENT, MGL-PAX/TRANSCRIBE and
  MGL-PAX/FULL systems. To keep deployed code small, client systems
  should declare an ASDF dependency on this system, never on the
  others, which are intended for autoloading and interactive use.

## Links

Here is the [official
repository](https://github.com/melisgl/mgl-pax) and the [HTML
documentation](http://melisgl.github.io/mgl-pax-world/mgl-pax-manual.html)
for the latest version.

## Background

As a user, I frequently run into documentation that's incomplete
and out of date, so I tend to stay in the editor and explore the
code by jumping around with SLIME's [`M-.`][SLIME-M-.]. As a library
author, I spend a great deal of time polishing code but precious
little writing documentation.

[SLIME-M-.]: http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/doc/html/Finding-definitions.html#Finding-definitions 

In fact, I rarely write anything more comprehensive than docstrings
for exported stuff. Writing docstrings feels easier than writing a
separate user manual, and they are always close at hand during
development. The drawback of this style is that users of the library
have to piece the big picture together themselves.

That's easy to solve, I thought, let's just put all the narrative
that holds docstrings together in the code and be a bit like a
Literate Programming weenie turned inside out. The original
prototype, which did almost everything I wanted, was this:

```
(defmacro defsection (name docstring)
  `(defun ,name () ,docstring))
```

Armed with this `DEFSECTION`, I soon found myself organizing code
following the flow of user level documentation and relegated
comments to implementational details entirely. However, some
portions of `DEFSECTION` docstrings were just listings of all the
functions, macros and variables related to the narrative, and this
list was effectively repeated in the DEFPACKAGE form complete with
little comments that were like section names. A clear violation of
[OAOO][oaoo], one of them had to go, so `DEFSECTION` got a list of
symbols to export.

[oaoo]: http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?OnceAndOnlyOnce 

That was great, but soon I found that the listing of symbols is
ambiguous if, for example, a function, a compiler macro and a class
are named by the same symbol. This did not concern exporting, of
course, but it didn't help readability. Distractingly, on such
symbols, `M-.` was popping up selection dialogs. There were two
birds to kill, and the symbol got accompanied by a type, which was
later generalized into the concept of locatives:

```commonlisp
(defsection @mgl-pax-introduction ()
  "A single line for one man ..."
  (foo class)
  (bar function))
```

After a bit of elisp hacking, `M-.` was smart enough to disambiguate
based on the locative found in the vicinity of the symbol, and
everything was good for a while.

Then I realized that sections could refer to other sections if there
were a SECTION locative. Going down that path, I soon began to feel
the urge to generate pretty documentation as all the necessary
information was manifest in the DEFSECTION forms. The design
constraint imposed on documentation generation was that following
the typical style of upcasing symbols in docstrings there should be
no need to explicitly mark up links: if `M-.` works, then the
documentation generator shall also be able find out what's being
referred to.

I settled on [Markdown][markdown] as a reasonably non-intrusive
format, and a few thousand lines later PAX was born.

[markdown]: https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ 


## Tutorial

PAX provides an extremely poor man's Explorable Programming
environment. Narrative primarily lives in so called sections that
mix markdown docstrings with references to functions, variables,
etc, all of which should probably have their own docstrings.

The primary focus is on making code easily explorable by using
SLIME's `M-.` (`slime-edit-definition`). See how to enable some
fanciness in @MGL-PAX-NAVIGATING-IN-EMACS.
@MGL-PAX-GENERATING-DOCUMENTATION from sections and all the
referenced items in Markdown or HTML format is also implemented.

With the simplistic tools provided, one may accomplish similar
effects as with Literate Programming, but documentation is generated
from code, not vice versa and there is no support for chunking. Code
is first, code must look pretty, documentation is code.

In typical use, PAX packages have no :EXPORT's defined. Instead the
DEFINE-PACKAGE form gets a docstring, which may mention section
names (defined with DEFSECTION). When the code is loaded into the
lisp, pressing `M-.` in SLIME on the name of the section will take
you there. Sections can also refer to other sections, packages,
functions, etc and you can keep exploring.

Here is an example of how it all works together:

```common-lisp
(mgl-pax:define-package :foo-random
  (:documentation "This package provides various utilities for random.
  See FOO-RANDOM:@FOO-RANDOM-MANUAL.")
  (:use #:common-lisp #:mgl-pax))

(in-package :foo-random)

(defsection @foo-random-manual (:title "Foo Random manual")
  "Here you describe what's common to all the referenced (and
  exported) functions that follow. They work with *FOO-STATE*, and
  have a :RANDOM-STATE keyword arg. Also explain when to choose
  which."
  (foo-random-state class)
  (state (reader foo-random-state))
  "Hey we can also print states!"
  (print-object (method () (foo-random-state t)))
  (*foo-state* variable)
  (gaussian-random function)
  (uniform-random function)
  ;; this is a subsection
  (@foo-random-examples section))

(defclass foo-random-state ()
  ((state :reader state)))

(defmethod print-object ((object foo-random-state) stream)
  (print-unreadable-object (object stream :type t)))

(defvar *foo-state* (make-instance 'foo-random-state)
  "Much like *RANDOM-STATE* but uses the FOO algorithm.")

(defun uniform-random (limit &key (random-state *foo-state*))
  "Return a random number from the between 0 and LIMIT (exclusive)
  uniform distribution."
  nil)

(defun gaussian-random (stddev &key (random-state *foo-state*))
  "Return a random number from a zero mean normal distribution with
  STDDEV."
  nil)

(defsection @foo-random-examples (:title "Examples")
  "Let's see the transcript of a real session of someone working
  with FOO:

  ```cl-transcript
  (values (princ :hello) (list 1 2))
  .. HELLO
  => :HELLO
  => (1 2)

  (make-instance 'foo-random-state)
  ==> #<FOO-RANDOM-STATE >
  ```")
```

Generating documentation in a very stripped down markdown format
is easy:

```commonlisp
(describe @foo-random-manual)
```

For this example, the generated markdown would look like this:

    # Foo Random manual
    
    ###### \[in package FOO-RANDOM\]
    Here you describe what's common to all the referenced (and
    exported) functions that follow. They work with *FOO-STATE*,
    and have a :RANDOM-STATE keyword arg. Also explain when to
    choose which.
    
    - [class] FOO-RANDOM-STATE
    
    - [reader] STATE FOO-RANDOM-STATE
    
    Hey we can also print states!
    
    - [method] PRINT-OBJECT (OBJECT FOO-RANDOM-STATE) STREAM
    
    - [variable] *FOO-STATE* #<FOO-RANDOM-STATE >
    
        Much like *RANDOM-STATE* but uses the FOO algorithm.
    
    - [function] GAUSSIAN-RANDOM STDDEV &KEY (RANDOM-STATE *FOO-STATE*)
    
        Return a random number from a zero mean normal distribution with
        STDDEV.
    
    - [function] UNIFORM-RANDOM LIMIT &KEY (RANDOM-STATE *FOO-STATE*)
    
        Return a random number from the between 0 and LIMIT (exclusive)
        uniform distribution.
    
    ## Examples
    
    Let's see the transcript of a real session of someone working
    with FOO:
    
    ```cl-transcript
    (values (princ :hello) (list 1 2))
    .. HELLO
    => :HELLO
    => (1 2)
    
    (make-instance 'foo-random-state)
    ==> #<FOO-RANDOM-STATE >
    
    ```

Fancier markdown or HTML output with [automatic
markup][*document-uppercase-is-code* variable] and
[linking][@mgl-pax-linking-to-code section] of uppercase symbol
names found in docstrings, section numbering, table of contents, etc
is possible by calling the DOCUMENT function.

*One can even generate documentation for different but related
libraries at the same time with the output going to different files
but with cross-page links being automatically added for symbols
mentioned in docstrings. See @MGL-PAX-GENERATING-DOCUMENTATION for
some convenience functions to cover the most common cases.*

Note how `(VARIABLE *FOO-STATE*)` in the DEFSECTION form both
exports `*FOO-STATE*` and includes its documentation in
`@FOO-RANDOM-MANUAL`. The symbols [VARIABLE][locative] and
[FUNCTION][locative] are just two instances of
[locatives][@MGL-PAX-LOCATIVE-TYPES section], which are used in
DEFSECTION to refer to definitions tied to symbols.

The transcript in the code block tagged with `cl-transcript` is
automatically checked for up-to-dateness. See
@MGL-PAX-TRANSCRIPTS.

## Basics

Now let's examine the most important pieces.

- [macro] DEFSECTION NAME (&KEY (PACKAGE '\*PACKAGE\*) (READTABLE '\*READTABLE\*) (EXPORT T) TITLE LINK-TITLE-TO (DISCARD-DOCUMENTATION-P \*DISCARD-DOCUMENTATION-P\*)) &BODY ENTRIES

    Define a documentation section and maybe export referenced symbols.
    A bit behind the scenes, a global variable with NAME is defined and
    is bound to a [SECTION][class] object. By convention, section names
    start with the character `@`. See @MGL-PAX-TUTORIAL for an example.
    
    ##### Entries
    
    ENTRIES consists of docstrings and references in any order.
    Docstrings are arbitrary strings in markdown format.
    
    REFERENCES are given in the form `(OBJECT LOCATIVE)`. For example,
    `(FOO FUNCTION)` refers to the function `FOO`, `(@BAR SECTION)` says
    that `@BAR` is a subsection of this one. `(BAZ (METHOD () (T T T)))`
    refers to the default method of the three argument generic function
    `BAZ`. `(FOO FUNCTION)` is equivalent to `(FOO (FUNCTION))`. See
    @MGL-PAX-LOCATIVES-AND-REFERENCES for more.
    
    The same object may occur in multiple references, typically with
    different locatives, but this is not required.
    
    The references are not looked up (see RESOLVE in the
    @MGL-PAX-EXTENSION-API) until documentation is generated, so it is
    allowed to refer to things yet to be defined.
    
    ##### Exporting
    
    If EXPORT is true (the default), NAME and the objects which are
    SYMBOLs are candidates for exporting. A candidate symbol is exported
    if
    
    - it is accessible in PACKAGE (it's not `OTHER-PACKAGE:SOMETHING`),
      and
    
    - there is a reference to it in the section being defined with a
      locative whose type is approved by EXPORTABLE-LOCATIVE-TYPE-P.
    
    See DEFINE-PACKAGE if you use the export feature. The idea with
    confounding documentation and exporting is to force documentation of
    all exported symbols.
    
    ##### Misc
    
    TITLE is a non-marked-up string or NIL. If non-NIL, it determines
    the text of the heading in the generated output. LINK-TITLE-TO is a
    reference given as an
    `(OBJECT LOCATIVE)` pair or NIL, to which the heading will link when
    generating HTML. If not specified, the heading will link to its own
    anchor.
    
    When DISCARD-DOCUMENTATION-P (defaults to *DISCARD-DOCUMENTATION-P*)
    is true, ENTRIES will not be recorded to save memory.

- [variable] *DISCARD-DOCUMENTATION-P* NIL

    The default value of DEFSECTION's DISCARD-DOCUMENTATION-P argument.
    One may want to set *DISCARD-DOCUMENTATION-P* to true before
    building a binary application.

- [macro] DEFINE-PACKAGE PACKAGE &REST OPTIONS

    This is like CL:DEFPACKAGE but silences warnings and errors
    signaled when the redefined package is at variance with the current
    state of the package. Typically this situation occurs when symbols
    are exported by calling EXPORT (as is the case with DEFSECTION) as
    opposed to adding :EXPORT forms to the DEFPACKAGE form and the
    package definition is reevaluated. See the section on [package
    variance](http://www.sbcl.org/manual/#Package-Variance) in the SBCL
    manual.
    
    The bottom line is that if you rely on DEFSECTION to do the
    exporting, then you'd better use DEFINE-PACKAGE.

## Locatives and References

To [navigate with `M-.`][@MGL-PAX-NAVIGATING-IN-EMACS section]
and to [generate documentation][@MGL-PAX-GENERATING-DOCUMENTATION
section] we need to refer to things such as the `FOO` type or the
`FOO` function.

```
(deftype foo ()
  "type doc"
  '(or integer real).

(defun foo ()
  "function doc"
  7)
```

The docstring is available via `(CL:DOCUMENTATION 'FOO 'TYPE)`,
where `TYPE` - called `DOC-TYPE` - is what tells CL:DOCUMENTATION
that we want the docstring of the type named `FOO`. This design
supports disambiguation and working with things that are not
first-class, such as types.

PAX generalizes `DOC-TYPE` to the concept of @LOCATIVEs, which may
also take arguments. An @OBJECT and a @LOCATIVE together are called
a @REFERENCE, and they identify a single thing. REFERENCEs are
actual objects, but often they appear as an `(OBJECT LOCATIVE)`
list (see DEFSECTION) or as `"OBJECT LOCATIVE"` in docstrings (see
@MGL-PAX-LINKING-TO-CODE for the various forms possible).

```
(defsection @foos ()
  "We discuss the FOO type and the FOO function."
  (foo type)
  (foo function))
```


- [glossary-term] reference

    A @REFERENCE is an @OBJECT plus a @LOCATIVE, and it identifies a
    definition. For example, the symbol `FOO` as the object and the
    symbol [`FUNCTION`][locative] as the locative together refer to the
    global definition of the function `FOO`.
    
    REFERENCE objects can be represented as an `(OBJECT LOCATIVE)` list
    as in DEFSECTION entries, or textually as `"FOO function"` where
    `FOO` is a @NAME or similar (see @MGL-PAX-CODIFICATION and
    @MGL-PAX-LINKING-TO-CODE).

- [glossary-term] object

    @OBJECTs are symbols or strings which name [functions][function locative],
    [types][type locative], [packages][package locative], etc. Together
    with @LOCATIVEs, they form @REFERENCEs.

- [glossary-term] locative

    @LOCATIVEs specify a *type* of definition such as
    [FUNCTION][locative] or [VARIABLE][locative] and together with
    @OBJECTs form @REFERENCEs.
    
    A locative can be a symbol or a list whose CAR is a symbol. In
    either case, the symbol is called the [locative
    type][@mgl-pax-locative-types section] while the rest of the
    elements are the *locative arguments*. See the METHOD locative or
    the LOCATIVE locative for examples of locative types with
    arguments.

## Locative Types

As we have already briefly seen in DEFSECTION and
@MGL-PAX-LOCATIVES-AND-REFERENCES, locatives allow us to refer to,
document and find the source location of various definitions beyond
what standard Common Lisp offers. See @MGL-PAX-EXTENSION-API for a
more detailed treatment. The following are the locatives types
supported out of the box. As all locative types, they are symbols,
and their names should make it obvious what kind of things they
refer to. Unless otherwise noted, locatives take no arguments.

When there is a corresponding CL type, a locative can be resolved to
a unique object as is the case in `(LOCATE 'FOO 'CLASS)` returning
`#<CLASS FOO>`. Even if there is no such CL type, the source
location and the docstring of the defining form is recorded (see
LOCATE-AND-FIND-SOURCE, LOCATE-AND-DOCUMENT in the
@MGL-PAX-EXTENSION-API), which makes navigating the sources with
`M-.` (see @MGL-PAX-NAVIGATING-IN-EMACS) and
@MGL-PAX-GENERATING-DOCUMENTATION possible.

### Locatives for Variables

- [locative] VARIABLE &OPTIONAL INITFORM

    Refers to a global special variable. INITFORM, or if not specified,
    the global value of the variable is included in the documentation.
    
    ```
    ;;; A REFERENCE is returned because there is no such type as VARIABLE.
    (locate '*FORMAT* 'variable)
    ==> #<REFERENCE *FORMAT* VARIABLE>
    ```
    
    For the output of `(DOCUMENT (MAKE-REFERENCE '*FORMAT* 'VARIABLE))`,
    see *FORMAT*. Note that *FORMAT* is unbound. If the variable is
    BOUNDP, then its *current* value is included in the documentation.
    See *DOCUMENT-LINK-CODE* for an example output. To override the
    current value, `INITFORM` may be provided. This is particulary
    useful if the value of the variable is something undesirable such as
    `#<MY-CLASS {100171ED93}>`.

- [locative] CONSTANT &OPTIONAL INITFORM

    Refers to a DEFCONSTANT. INITFORM, or if not specified,
    the value of the constant is included in the documentation. The
    CONSTANT locative is like the VARIABLE locative, but it also checks
    that its object is CONSTANTP.

### Locatives for Macros

- [locative] MACRO

    Refers to a global macro, typically defined with DEFMACRO or a
    [special operator][SPECIAL-OPERATOR-P FUNCTION]. See the FUNCTION
    locative for a note on arglists.

- [locative] SYMBOL-MACRO

    Refers to a global symbol macro, defined with DEFINE-SYMBOL-MACRO.
    Note that since DEFINE-SYMBOL-MACRO does not support docstrings, PAX
    defines methods on the DOCUMENTATION generic function specialized
    for `DOC-TYPE` SYMBOL-MACRO.
    
    ```
    (define-symbol-macro my-mac 42)
    (setf (documentation 'my-mac 'symbol-macro)
          "This is MY-MAC.")
    (documentation 'my-mac 'symbol-macro)
    ```


- [locative] COMPILER-MACRO

    Refers to a compiler macro, typically defined with
    DEFINE-COMPILER-MACRO. See the FUNCTION locative for a note on
    arglists.

### Locatives for Functions

- [locative] FUNCTION

    Refers to a global function, typically defined with DEFUN.
    
    Note that the arglist in the generated documentation depends on the
    quality of SWANK-BACKEND:ARGLIST. It [may
    be][@mgl-pax-document-implementation-notes section] that default
    values of optional and keyword arguments are missing.

- [locative] GENERIC-FUNCTION

    Refers to a [GENERIC-FUNCTION][class], typically defined with
    DEFGENERIC.

- [locative] METHOD METHOD-QUALIFIERS METHOD-SPECIALIZERS

    See CL:FIND-METHOD for the description of the arguments
    METHOD-QUALIFIERS and METHOD-SPECIALIZERS. For example,
    a `(FOO (METHOD () (T (EQL XXX))))` as a DEFSECTION entry refers to
    this method:
    
        (defmethod foo (x (y (eql 'xxx)))
          ...)
    
    METHOD is not EXPORTABLE-LOCATIVE-TYPE-P.

- [locative] METHOD-COMBINATION

    Refers to a [METHOD-COMBINATION][class], defined with
    DEFINE-METHOD-COMBINATION.

- [locative] ACCESSOR CLASS-NAME

    To refer to an accessor named `FOO-SLOT` of class
    `FOO`:
    
        (foo-slot (accessor foo))


- [locative] READER CLASS-NAME

    To refer to a reader named `FOO-SLOT` of class
    `FOO`:
    
        (foo-slot (reader foo))


- [locative] WRITER CLASS-NAME

    To refer to a writer named `FOO-SLOT` of class
    `FOO`:
    
        (foo-slot (writer foo))


- [locative] STRUCTURE-ACCESSOR

    This is a synonym of [FUNCTION][locative] with the difference that
    the often ugly and certainly uninformative lambda list will not be
    printed.

### Locatives for Types and Declarations

- [locative] TYPE

    This locative can refer to any Lisp type. For types defined with
    DEFTYPE, an attempt is made at printing the arguments of type
    specifiers. When TYPE refers to a [CL:CLASS][class], the class is
    documented as an opaque type: no mention is made of that it is a
    class or its superclasses. Use the CLASS locative if those things
    are part of the contract.

- [locative] CLASS

    Naturally, CLASS is the locative type for [CLASS][class]es.
    To refer to a class named FOO:
    
        (foo class)
    
    In the generated documention, only superclasses denoted by [external
    symbols][find-symbol function] are included.

- [locative] DECLARATION

    Refers to a declaration, used in DECLARE, DECLAIM and PROCLAIM.
    For example, `[DEBUG][declaration]` refers to the standard DEBUG
    declaration and links to the hyperspec if
    *DOCUMENT-LINK-TO-HYPERSPEC* is true.
    
    User code may also define new declarations with CLTL2 functionality,
    but there is no way to provide a docstring.
    
    ```
    (cl-environments:define-declaration my-decl (&rest things)
      (values :declare (cons 'foo things)))
    ```
    
    Also, `M-.` (see @MGL-PAX-NAVIGATING-IN-EMACS) on declarations
    currently only works on SBCL.

### Condition System Locatives

- [locative] CONDITION

    CONDITION is the locative type for [CONDITION][condition]s. To
    refer to a condition named FOO:
    
        (foo condition)
    
    In the generated documention, only superclasses denoted by [external
    symbols][find-symbol function] are included.

- [locative] RESTART

    A locative to refer to the definition of a restart defined by
    DEFINE-RESTART.

- [macro] DEFINE-RESTART SYMBOL LAMBDA-LIST &BODY DOCSTRING

    A definer macro to hang the documentation of a restart on a
    symbol.
    
    ```
    (define-restart my-ignore-error ()
      "Available when MY-ERROR is signalled, MY-IGNORE-ERROR unsafely continues.")
    ```
    
    Then `(MY-IGNORE-ERROR RESTART)` refers to the above definition.
    Note that while there is a CL:RESTART type, there is no
    corresponding source location or docstring like for
    [CONDITION][condition]s.

### Locatives for Packages and Readtables

- [locative] ASDF/SYSTEM:SYSTEM

    Refers to an asdf system. The generated documentation will include
    meta information extracted from the system definition. This also
    serves as an example of a symbol that's not accessible in the
    current package and consequently is not exported.
    
    ASDF:SYSTEM is not EXPORTABLE-LOCATIVE-TYPE-P.

- [locative] PACKAGE

    Refers to a [PACKAGE][type], defined by DEFPACKAGE. PACKAGE is not
    EXPORTABLE-LOCATIVE-TYPE-P.

- [locative] READTABLE

    Refers to a named [READTABLE][] defined with
    NAMED-READTABLES:DEFREADTABLE, which associates a global name and a
    docstring with the readtable object. Unfortunately, source location
    information is not available.

### Locatives for PAX Constructs

- [locative] SECTION

    Refers to a section defined by DEFSECTION.

- [locative] GLOSSARY-TERM

    Refers to a glossary term defined by DEFINE-GLOSSARY-TERM.

- [macro] DEFINE-GLOSSARY-TERM NAME (&KEY TITLE (DISCARD-DOCUMENTATION-P \*DISCARD-DOCUMENTATION-P\*)) DOCSTRING

    Define a global variable with NAME and set it to a glossary term
    object. A glossary term is just a symbol to hang a docstring on. It
    is a bit like a SECTION in that, when linked to, its TITLE will be
    the link text instead of the name of the symbol. Unlike sections
    though, glossary terms are not rendered with headings, but in the
    more lightweight bullet + locative + name/title style.
    
    When DISCARD-DOCUMENTATION-P (defaults to *DISCARD-DOCUMENTATION-P*)
    is true, DOCSTRING will not be recorded to save memory.

- [locative] LOCATIVE LAMBDA-LIST

    This is the locative for locatives. When `M-.` is pressed on
    `SOME-NAME` in `(SOME-NAME LOCATIVE)`, this is what makes it
    possible to land at the corresponding DEFINE-LOCATIVE-TYPE form.
    Similarly, `(LOCATIVE LOCATIVE)` leads to this very definition.

- [locative] DISLOCATED

    Refers to a symbol in a non-specific context. Useful for preventing
    autolinking. For example, if there is a function called `FOO` then
    
        `FOO`
    
    will be linked (if *DOCUMENT-LINK-CODE*) to its definition. However,
    
        [`FOO`][dislocated]
    
    will not be. On a dislocated locative LOCATE always fails with a
    LOCATE-ERROR condition. See @MGL-PAX-LINKING-TO-CODE for an
    alternative method of preventing autolinking.

- [locative] ARGUMENT

    An alias for DISLOCATED, so the one can refer to an argument of a
    macro without accidentally linking to a class that has the same name
    as that argument. In the following example, FORMAT may
    link to CL:FORMAT (if we generated documentation for it):
    
    ```
    "See the FORMAT in DOCUMENT."
    ```
    
    Since ARGUMENT is a locative, we can prevent that linking by writing:
    
    ```
    "See the FORMAT argument of DOCUMENT."
    ```


- [locative] INCLUDE SOURCE &KEY LINE-PREFIX HEADER FOOTER HEADER-NL FOOTER-NL

    Refers to a region of a file. SOURCE can be a string or a
    pathname in which case the whole file is being pointed to or it can
    explicitly supply START, END locatives. INCLUDE is typically used to
    include non-lisp files in the documentation (say markdown or elisp
    as in the next example) or regions of lisp source files. This can
    reduce clutter and duplication.
    
    ```commonlisp
    (defsection example-section ()
      (pax.el (include #.(asdf:system-relative-pathname :mgl-pax "src/pax.el")
                       :header-nl "```elisp" :footer-nl "```"))
      (foo-example (include (:start (foo function)
                             :end (end-of-foo-example variable))
                            :header-nl "```commonlisp"
                            :footer-nl "```"))
    
    (defun foo (x)
      (1+ x))
    
    ;;; Since file regions are copied verbatim, comments survive.
    (defmacro bar ())
    
    ;;; This comment is the last thing in FOO-EXAMPLE's
    ;;; documentation since we use the dummy END-OF-FOO-EXAMPLE
    ;;; variable to mark the end location.
    (defvar end-of-foo-example)
    
    ;;; More irrelevant code follows.
    ```
    
    In the above example, pressing `M-.` on `PAX.EL` will open the
    `src/pax.el` file and put the cursor on its first character. `M-.`
    on `FOO-EXAMPLE` will go to the source location of the `(asdf:system
    locative)` locative.
    
    When documentation is generated, the entire `src/pax.el` file is
    included in the markdown surrounded by the strings given as
    HEADER-NL and FOOTER-NL (if any). The trailing newline character is
    assumed implicitly. If that's undesirable, then use HEADER and
    FOOTER instead. The documentation of `FOO-EXAMPLE` will be the
    region of the file from the source location of the START
    locative (inclusive) to the source location of the END
    locative (exclusive). START and END default to the beginning and end
    of the file, respectively.
    
    Note that the file of the source location of :START and :END must be
    the same. If SOURCE is pathname designator, then it must be absolute
    so that the locative is context independent.
    
    Finally, if specified LINE-PREFIX is a string that's prepended to
    each line included in the documentation. For example, a string of
    four spaces makes markdown think it's a code block.
    
    INCLUDE is not EXPORTABLE-LOCATIVE-TYPE-P.

### External Locatives

- [locative] CLHS

    Refers to sections in the Common Lisp hyperspec. These have no
    source location so `M-.` will not work. What works is linking. The
    following markdown examples all produce a link to CLHS `3.4`, the
    section 'Lambda Lists', which is in file `03_d.htm`.
    
    ```
    CLHS `3.4`
    `3.4` CLHS
    [3.4][]
    [`3.4`][]
    [3.4][CLHS]
    [Lambda Lists][clhs]
    [03_d][clhs]
    ```
    
    The rules of matching sections are the following. If the object of
    the reference is STRING= to the section number string (without the
    trailing dot) or to the name of its file without the `.htm`
    extension, then the reference refers to that section. Else, if the
    object is a case-insensitive substring of the title of some section,
    then the reference refers to the first such section in breadth-first
    order.
    
    To link to issue and issue summary pages, all of the above markdown
    examples work, just make the object of the reference the name of the
    issue prefixed by `ISSUE:` or `SUMMARY:` as appropriate. For
    example, to refer to the `AREF-1D` issue use `[ISSUE:AREF-1D][clhs]`
    and get [ISSUE:AREF-1D][clhs]. Similary, `[SUMMARY:AREF-1D][clhs]`
    turns into [SUMMARY:AREF-1D][clhs]. Alternatively, matching the name
    of the file also works (`[iss009][clhs]` renders as [iss009][clhs])
    
    The generated links are relative to *DOCUMENT-HYPERSPEC-ROOT*.
    
    To detach the discussion from markdown syntax, let's see these cases
    through the programmatic interface.
    
    ```
    (locate "3.4" 'clhs)
    ==> #<REFERENCE "3.4" CLHS>
    (locate "03_d" 'clhs)
    ==> #<REFERENCE "03_d" CLHS>
    (locate "lambda" 'clhs)
    ==> #<REFERENCE "3.4" CLHS>
    (locate "ISSUE:AREF-1D" 'clhs)
    ==> #<REFERENCE "ISSUE:AREF-1D" CLHS>
    (locate "SUMMARY:AREF-1D" 'clhs)
    ==> #<REFERENCE "SUMMARY:AREF-1D" CLHS>
    ```


## Navigating Sources in Emacs

Integration into SLIME's `M-.` (`slime-edit-definition`) allows one
to visit the source location of the thing that's identified by a
symbol and the locative before or after the symbol in a buffer. With
this extension, if a locative is the previous or the next expression
around the symbol of interest, then `M-.` will go straight to the
definition which corresponds to the locative. If that fails, `M-.`
will try to find the definitions in the normal way, which may
involve popping up an xref buffer and letting the user interactively
select one of possible definitions.

In the following examples, pressing `M-.` when the cursor is on one
of the characters of `FOO` or just after `FOO`, will visit the
definition of function `FOO`:

    function foo
    foo function
    (function foo)
    (foo function)

In particular, references in a DEFSECTION form are in (SYMBOL
LOCATIVE) format so `M-.` will work just fine there.

Just like vanilla `M-.`, this works in comments and docstrings. In
the next example, pressing `M-.` on `FOO` will visit `FOO`'s default
method:

```commonlisp
;;;; See FOO `(method () (t t t))` for how this all works.
;;;; But if the locative has semicolons inside: FOO `(method
;;;; () (t t t))`, then it won't, so be wary of line breaks
;;;; in comments.
```

With a prefix argument (`C-u M-.`), one can enter a symbol plus a
locative separated by whitespace to preselect one of the
possibilities.

The `M-.` extensions can be enabled by loading `src/pax.el`.

## Generating Documentation

- [function] DOCUMENT OBJECT &KEY STREAM PAGES (FORMAT :MARKDOWN)

    Write OBJECT in FORMAT to STREAM diverting some output to PAGES.
    FORMAT can be anything [3BMD][3bmd] supports, which is currently
    :MARKDOWN, :HTML and :PLAIN. STREAM may be a stream object, T or NIL
    as with CL:FORMAT.
    
    Most often, this function is called on section objects
    like `(DOCUMENT @MGL-PAX-MANUAL)`, but it supports all kinds of
    objects for which DOCUMENT-OBJECT is defined. To look up the
    documentation of function DOCUMENT:
    
        (document #'document)
    
    To generate the documentation for separate libraries with automatic
    cross-links:
    
        (document (list @cube-manual @mat-manual))
    
    Note that not only first class objects can have documentation. For
    instance, variables and deftypes are not represented by objects.
    That's why CL:DOCUMENTATION has a DOC-TYPE argument. DOCUMENT does
    not have anything like that, instead it relies on REFERENCE objects
    to carry the extra information. We are going to see later how
    references and locatives work. Until then, here is an example on how
    to look up the documentation of type `FOO`:
    
        (document (locate 'foo 'type))
    
    One can call DESCRIBE on [SECTION][class] objects to get
    documentation in markdown format with less markup than the default.
    See DESCRIBE-OBJECT `(METHOD () (SECTION T))`.
    
    There are quite a few special variables that affect how output is
    generated, see @MGL-PAX-CODIFICATION, @MGL-PAX-LINKING-TO-CODE,
    @MGL-PAX-LINKING-TO-SECTIONS, and
    @MGL-PAX-MISCELLANEOUS-DOCUMENTATION-PRINTER-VARIABLES.
    
    The rest of this description deals with how to generate multiple
    pages.
    
    The PAGES argument is to create multi-page documents by routing some
    of the generated output to files, strings or streams. PAGES is a
    list of page specification elements. A page spec is a plist with
    keys :OBJECTS, :OUTPUT, :URI-FRAGMENT, :SOURCE-URI-FN, :HEADER-FN
    and :FOOTER-FN. OBJECTS is a list of objects (references are allowed
    but not required) whose documentation is to be sent to `OUTPUT`.
    
    When documentation for an object is generated, the first matching
    page spec is used, where the object matches the page spec if it is
    [reachable][COLLECT-REACHABLE-OBJECTS generic-function] from one of
    its :OBJECTS.
    
    `OUTPUT` can be a number things:
    
    - If it's a list whose first element is a string or a pathname, then
      output will be sent to the file denoted by that and the rest of
      the elements of the list are passed on as arguments to CL:OPEN.
      One extra keyword argument is :ENSURE-DIRECTORIES-EXIST. If it's
      true, ENSURE-DIRECTORIES-EXIST will be called on the pathname
      before it's opened.
    
    - If it's NIL, then output will be collected in a string.
    
    - If it's T, then output will be sent to *STANDARD-OUTPUT*.
    
    - If it's a stream, then output will be sent to that stream.
    
    If some pages are specified, DOCUMENT returns a list of designators
    for generated output. If a page whose `OUTPUT` refers to a file that
    was created (which doesn't happen if nothing would be written to
    it), then the corresponding pathname is included in the list. For
    strings the string itself, while for streams the stream object is
    included in the list. This way it's possible to write some pages to
    files and some to strings and have the return value indicate what
    was created. The output designators in the returned list are ordered
    by creation time.
    
    If no PAGES are specified, DOCUMENT returns a single pathname,
    string or stream object according to the value of the STREAM
    argument.
    
    Note that even if PAGES is specified, STREAM acts as a catch all
    taking the generated documentation for references not claimed by any
    pages. Also, the filename, string or stream corresponding to STREAM
    is always the first element in list of generated things that is the
    return value.
    
    HEADER-FN, if not NIL, is a function of a single stream argument,
    which is called just before the first write to the page. Since
    :FORMAT :HTML only generates HTML fragments, this makes it possible
    to print arbitrary headers, typically setting the title, css
    stylesheet, or charset.
    
    FOOTER-FN is similar to HEADER-FN, but it's called after the last
    write to the page. For HTML, it typically just closes the body.
    
    URI-FRAGMENT is a string such as `"doc/manual.html"` that specifies
    where the page will be deployed on a webserver. It defines how links
    between pages will look. If it's not specified and `OUTPUT` refers
    to a file, then it defaults to the name of the file. If URI-FRAGMENT
    is NIL, then no links will be made to or from that page.
    
    Finally, SOURCE-URI-FN is a function of a single, REFERENCE
    argument. If it returns a value other than NIL, then it must be a
    string representing an URI. If FORMAT is :HTML and
    *DOCUMENT-MARK-UP-SIGNATURES* is true, then the locative as
    displayed in the signature will be a link to this uri. See
    MAKE-GITHUB-SOURCE-URI-FN.
    
    PAGES may look something like this:
    
    ```commonlisp
    `((;; The section about SECTIONs and everything below it ...
       :objects (, @mgl-pax-sections)
       ;; ... is so boring that it's not worth the disk space, so
       ;; send it to a string.
       :output (nil)
       ;; Explicitly tell other pages not to link to these guys.
       :uri-fragment nil)
      ;; Send the @MGL-PAX-EXTENSION-API section and everything reachable
      ;; from it ...
      (:objects (, @mgl-pax-extension-api)
       ;; ... to build/tmp/pax-extension-api.html.
       :output ("build/tmp/pax-extension-api.html")
       ;; However, on the web server html files will be at this
       ;; location relative to some common root, so override the
       ;; default:
       :uri-fragment "doc/dev/pax-extension-api.html"
       ;; Set html page title, stylesheet, charset.
       :header-fn 'write-html-header
       ;; Just close the body.
       :footer-fn 'write-html-footer)
      ;; Catch the reference that were not reachable from the above. It
      ;; is important for this page spec to be last.
      (:objects (, @mgl-pax-manual)
       :output ("build/tmp/manual.html")
       ;; Links from the extension api page to the manual page will
       ;; be to ../user/pax-manual#<anchor>, while links going to
       ;; the opposite direction will be to
       ;; ../dev/pax-extension-api.html#<anchor>.
       :uri-fragment "doc/user/pax-manual.html"
       :header-fn 'write-html-header
       :footer-fn 'write-html-footer))
    ```

### Markdown Support

The [Markdown][markdown] in docstrings is processed with the
[3BMD][3bmd] library.

#### Indentation

Docstrings can be indented in any of the usual styles. PAX
normalizes indentation by converting:

    (defun foo ()
      "This is
      indented
      differently")

to

    (defun foo ()
      "This is
    indented
    differently")

See [DOCUMENT-OBJECT][(method () (string t))] for the details.

#### Syntax Highlighting

For syntax highlighting, github's [fenced code
blocks][fenced-code-blocks] markdown extension to mark up code
blocks with triple backticks is enabled so all you need to do is
write:

    ```elisp
    (defun foo ())
    ```

to get syntactically marked up HTML output. Copy `src/style.css`
from PAX and you are set. The language tag, `elisp` in this example,
is optional and defaults to `common-lisp`.

See the documentation of [3BMD][3bmd] and [colorize][colorize] for
the details.

[3bmd]: https://github.com/3b/3bmd 

[colorize]: https://github.com/redline6561/colorize/ 

[fenced-code-blocks]: https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown#fenced-code-blocks 


#### MathJax

Displaying pretty mathematics in TeX format is supported via
MathJax. It can be done inline with `$` like this:

    $\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$

which is diplayed as $\int\_0^\infty e^{-x^2}
dx=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$, or it can be delimited by `$$` like this:

    $$\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$$

to get: $$\int\_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$$

MathJax will leave code blocks (including those inline with
backticks) alone. Outside code blocks, escape `$` by prefixing it
with a backslash to scare MathJax off.

Escaping all those backslashes in TeX fragments embedded in Lisp
strings can be a pain. [Pythonic String
Reader][pythonic-string-reader] can help with that.

[pythonic-string-reader]: https://github.com/smithzvk/pythonic-string-reader 


### Codification

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-UPPERCASE-IS-CODE* T

    When true, *codifiable* and *interesting* words are assumed to be
    code as if they were marked up with backticks. For example, this
    docstring
    
        "T PRINT CLASSes SECTION *PACKAGE* MGL-PAX ASDF
        CaMeL Capital"
    
    is equivalent to this:
    
        "`T` `PRINT` `CLASS`es `SECTION` `*PACKAGE*` `MGL-PAX` `ASDF`
        CaMel Capital"
    
    and renders as
    
    `T` `PRINT` `CLASS`es `SECTION` `MGL-PAX` `ASDF` CaMel Capital
    
    where the links are added due to *DOCUMENT-LINK-CODE*.
    
    To suppress this behavior, add a backslash to the beginning of the
    symbol or right after the leading `\*` if it would otherwise be
    parsed as markdown emphasis:
    
        "\\SECTION *\\PACKAGE*"
    
    The number of backslashes is doubled above because that's how the
    example looks in a docstring. Note that the backslash is discarded
    even if *DOCUMENT-UPPERCASE-IS-CODE* is false.
    
    Now, some definitions. A word is **codifiable** iff
    
    - it has at least one uppercase character (e.g. not `<`, `<=` or
      `///`), and
    
    - it has no lowercase characters (e.g. `T`, `*PRINT-LENGTH*`) or
      all lowercase characters immediately follow at least two
      consecutive uppercase characters (e.g. `CLASSes` but not
      `Capital`).
    
    A word is **interesting** iff
    
    - it *names* a known reference, or
    
    - it is at least 3 characters long and names a package or a symbol
      external to its package.
    
    Finally, we say that a word **names** a known reference if the word
    matches the name of a thing being documented, or it is in the
    hyperspec and *DOCUMENT-UPPERCASE-IS-CODE* is true, or more
    precisely,
    
    - if the word matches [the object of a reference][REFERENCE-OBJECT
      reader] being documented (see DOCUMENT and
      COLLECT-REACHABLE-OBJECTS), or
    
    - the a name in the hyperspec if *DOCUMENT-LINK-TO-HYPERSPEC*.
    
    Symbols are read in the current *PACKAGE*, which is subject to
    *DOCUMENT-NORMALIZE-PACKAGES*.

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-DOWNCASE-UPPERCASE-CODE* NIL

    If true, then the names of symbols recognized as code (including
    those found if *DOCUMENT-UPPERCASE-IS-CODE*) are downcased in the
    output if they only consist of uppercase characters. If it is
    :ONLY-IN-MARKUP, then if the output format does not support
    markup (e.g. it's :PLAIN), then no downcasing is performed.

### Linking to Code

Before delving into the details, here is a quick summary of all
ways of linking to code.

##### Explicit Links

- `[SECTION][class]` renders as: [SECTION][class]
  (*object + locative*)

- `[see this][section class]` renders as: [see this][section class]
  (*explicit title + reference*)

Parsing of symbols relies on the current READTABLE-CASE, so usually
their case does not matter.

##### Autolinking with *DOCUMENT-UPPERCASE-IS-CODE*

- `LOCATE` renders as: LOCATE (*object with a single possible locative*)

- `SECTION` renders as: SECTION (*object with ambiguous locative*)

- `SECTION class` renders as: SECTION class (*object followed by
  locative*)


- `class SECTION` renders as: class SECTION (*object following locative*)

In these examples, autolinking can be prevented by preventing
codification of uppercase symbols (see
[*DOCUMENT-UPPERCASE-IS-CODE*][variable]).

##### Autolinking in code

If a single word is enclosed in backticks (i.e. it's code), then it
is autolinked. The following examples all render as the previous
ones except for the character case, which need not be uppercase in
this case.

```
`locate`
`section`
`section` class
class `section`
```

To prevent autolinking in the explicitly quoted case, a backslash
can be placed right after the opening backtick.

```
`\locate`
`\section`
`\section` class
class `\section`
```

Alternatively, the DISLOCATED locative may be used.

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-LINK-CODE* T

    When true, during the process of generating documentation for a
    [SECTION][class], HTML anchors are added before the documentation of
    every reference that's not to a section. Also, markdown style
    reference links are added when a piece of inline code found in a
    docstring refers to a symbol that's referenced by one of the
    sections being documented.
    
    ```commonlisp
    (defsection @foo (:export nil)
      (foo function)
      (bar function))
    
    (defun foo (x)
      "Calls `BAR` on `X`."
      (bar x))
    
    (defun bar (x)
      x)
    ```
    
    With the above definition the output of `(DOCUMENT @FOO :STREAM T)`
    would include this:
    
    ```
    .. <a id='x-28MGL-PAX-3AFOO-20FUNCTION-29'></a>
    ..
    .. - [function] **FOO** *X*
    ..
    ..     Calls [`BAR`][e2f2] on `X`.
    ..
    .. <a id='x-28MGL-PAX-3ABAR-20FUNCTION-29'></a>
    ..
    .. - [function] **BAR** *X*
    ..
    ..   [e2f2]: #x-28MGL-PAX-3ABAR-20FUNCTION-29 "(MGL-PAX:BAR FUNCTION)"
    ```
    
    The line starting with `[e2f2]:` is the markdown reference link
    definition with an url and a title. Here the url points to the HTML
    anchor of the documentation of the function `BAR`, itself an escaped
    version of the reference `(MGL-PAX:BAR FUNCTION)`, which is also the
    title.
    
    In the docstring of `FOO`, instead of `BAR`, one can write `[bar][]`
    or ``[`bar`][]`` as well. Since symbol names are parsed according to
    READTABLE-CASE, character case rarely matters.
    
    Now, if `BAR` has multiple references with different locatives:
    
    ```commonlisp
    (defsection @foo
      (foo function)
      (bar function)
      (bar type))
    
    (defun foo (x)
      "Calls `BAR` on `X`."
      (bar x))
    ```
    
    then documentation would link to all interpretations:
    
        - [function] FOO X
        
            Calls `BAR`([`1`][link-id-1] [`2`][link-id-2]) on `X`.
    
    This situation occurs in PAX with SECTION, which is both a
    class (see [SECTION][class]) and a locative type denoted by a
    symbol (see [SECTION][locative]). Back in the example above,
    clearly, there is no reason to link to type `BAR`, so one may wish
    to select the function locative. There are two ways to do that. One
    is to specify the locative explicitly as the id of a reference link:
    
        "Calls [BAR][function] on X."
    
    However, if in the text there is a locative immediately before or
    after the symbol, then that locative is used to narrow down the
    range of possibilities. This is similar to what the `M-.` extension
    does. In a nutshell, if `M-.` works without questions then the
    documentation will contain a single link. So this also works without
    any markup:
    
        "Calls function `BAR` on X."
    
    This last option needs backticks around the locative if it's not a
    single symbol.
    
    Within the same docstring, autolinking of code without explicit
    markdown reference links happens only for the first occurrence of
    the same object with the same locatives except for SECTIONs and
    GLOSSARY-TERMs. In the following docstring, only the first `FOO`
    will be turned into a link.
    
        "Oh, `FOO` is safe. `FOO` is great."
    
    On the other hand, if different locatives are found in the vicinity
    of two occurrences of `FOO`, then both will be linked.
    
        "Oh, function `FOO` is safe. Macro `FOO` is great."
    
    Note that *DOCUMENT-LINK-CODE* can be combined with
    *DOCUMENT-UPPERCASE-IS-CODE* to have links generated for uppercase
    names with no quoting required.

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-LINK-TO-HYPERSPEC* T

    If true, link symbols found in code to the Common Lisp Hyperspec.
    
    Locatives work as expected (see *DOCUMENT-LINK-CODE*).
    FIND-IF links to FIND-IF, FUNCTION links
    to FUNCTION and `[FUNCTION][type]` links to [FUNCTION][type].
    
    Autolinking to T and NIL is suppressed. If desired, use
    `[T][]` (that links to [T][]) or `[T][constant]` (that links to
    [T][constant]).
    
    Note that linking to sections in the Hyperspec is done with the CLHS
    locative and is not subject to the value of this variable.

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-HYPERSPEC-ROOT* "http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/"

    A URL pointing to an installed Common Lisp Hyperspec. The default
    value of is the canonical location.

#### Reference Resolution

Links are generated according to *DOCUMENT-LINK-CODE* in general
but with some additional heuristics for convenience.

##### Filtering Multiple References

When there are multiple references to link to - as seen in the
second example in *DOCUMENT-LINK-CODE* - some references are removed
by the following rules.

- References to ASDF:SYSTEMs are removed if there are other
  references which are not to ASDF:SYSTEMs. This is because system
  names often collide with the name of a class or function and are
  rarely useful to link to. Use explicit links to ASDF:SYSTEMs, if
  necessary.

- References to the CLHS are filtered similarly.

- If references include a GENERIC-FUNCTION locative, then all
  references with LOCATIVE-TYPE [METHOD][locative],
  [ACCESSOR][locative], [READER][locative] and [WRITER][locative]
  are removed to avoid linking to a possibly large number of
  methods.


##### Local References

To unclutter the generated output by reducing the number of
links, the so-called 'local' references (references to things for
which documentation is being generated) are treated specially. In
the following example, there are local references to the function
FOO and its arguments, so none of them get turned into links:

```common-lisp
(defun foo (arg1 arg2)
  "FOO takes two arguments: ARG1 and ARG2.")
```

If linking was desired one could write `[FOO][function]` or `FOO
function`, both of which result in a single link. An explicit link
with an unspecified locative like in `[*DOCUMENT-LINK-CODE*][]`
generates links to all references involving the *DOCUMENT-LINK-CODE*
symbol except the local ones.

The exact rules for local references are as follows:

- Unadorned names in code (e.g. `FOO`) do not get any links if there
  is *any* local reference with the same symbol.

- With a locative specified (e.g. in the explicit link
  `[FOO][function]` or in the text `the FOO function`), a single
  link is made irrespective of any local references.

- Explicit links with an unspecified locative (e.g. `[FOO][]`) are
  linked to all non-local references.


### Linking to Sections

The following variables control how to generate section numbering,
table of contents and navigation links.

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-LINK-SECTIONS* T

    When true, HTML anchors are generated before the heading of
    sections, which allows the table of contents to contain links and
    also code-like references to sections (like `@FOO-MANUAL`) to be
    translated to links with the section title being the name of the
    link.

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-MAX-NUMBERING-LEVEL* 3

    A non-negative integer. In their hierarchy, sections on levels less
    than this value get numbered in the format of `3.1.2`. Setting it to
    0 turns numbering off.

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-MAX-TABLE-OF-CONTENTS-LEVEL* 3

    A non-negative integer. Top-level sections are given a table of
    contents, which includes a nested tree of section titles whose depth
    is limited by this value. Setting it to 0 turns generation of the
    table of contents off. If *DOCUMENT-LINK-SECTIONS* is true, then the
    table of contents will link to the sections.

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-TEXT-NAVIGATION* NIL

    If true, then before each heading a line is printed with links to
    the previous, parent and next section. Needs
    *DOCUMENT-LINK-SECTIONS* to be on to work.

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-FANCY-HTML-NAVIGATION* T

    If true and the output format is HTML, then headings get a
    navigation component that consists of links to the previous, parent,
    next section and a permalink. This component is normally hidden, it
    is visible only when the mouse is over the heading. Needs
    *DOCUMENT-LINK-SECTIONS* to be on to work.

### Miscellaneous Variables

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-MIN-LINK-HASH-LENGTH* 4

    Recall that markdown reference style links (like `[label][id]`) are
    used for linking to sections and code. It is desirable to have ids
    that are short to maintain legibility of the generated markdown, but
    also stable to reduce the spurious diffs in the generated
    documentation, which can be a pain in a version control system.
    
    Clearly, there is a tradeoff here. This variable controls how many
    characters of the md5 sum of the full link id (the reference as a
    string) are retained. If collisions are found due to the low number
    of characters, then the length of the hash of the colliding
    reference is increased.
    
    This variable has no effect on the HTML generated from markdown, but
    it can make markdown output more readable.

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-MARK-UP-SIGNATURES* T

    When true, some things such as function names and arglists are
    rendered as bold and italic. In :HTML output, locative types become
    links to sources (if :SOURCE-URI-FN is provided, see DOCUMENT), and
    the symbol becomes a self-link for your permalinking pleasure.
    
    For example, a reference is rendered in markdown roughly as:
    
        - [function] foo x y
    
    With this option on, the above becomes:
    
        - [function] **foo** *x y*
    
    Also, in HTML `**foo**` will be a link to that very entry and
    `[function]` may turn into a link to sources.

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-NORMALIZE-PACKAGES* T

    Determines what *PACKAGE* and *READTABLE* are when working with
    generating documentation. If true and documentation is generated for
    a SECTION (including its SECTION-ENTRIES), then SECTION-PACKAGE and
    SECTION-READTABLE of the innermost containing section is used. To
    eliminate ambiguity `[in package ...]` messages are printed right
    after the section heading if necessary. If false, then *PACKAGE* and
    *READTABLE* are left at the current values.

### Utilities for Generating Documentation

Two convenience functions are provided to serve the common case of
having an ASDF system with some readmes and a directory with for the
HTML documentation and the default css stylesheet.

- [function] UPDATE-ASDF-SYSTEM-READMES SECTIONS ASDF-SYSTEM

    Convenience function to generate two readme files in the directory
    holding the ASDF-SYSTEM definition.
    
    README.md has anchors, links, inline code, and other markup added.
    Not necessarily the easiest on the eye in an editor, but looks good
    on github.
    
    README is optimized for reading in text format. Has no links and
    cluttery markup.
    
    Example usage:
    
    ```
    (update-asdf-system-readmes @mgl-pax-manual :mgl-pax)
    ```


- [function] UPDATE-ASDF-SYSTEM-HTML-DOCS SECTIONS ASDF-SYSTEM &KEY PAGES (TARGET-DIR (ASDF/SYSTEM:SYSTEM-RELATIVE-PATHNAME ASDF-SYSTEM "doc/")) (UPDATE-CSS-P T)

    Generate pretty HTML documentation for a single ASDF system,
    possibly linking to github. If UPDATE-CSS-P, copy the CSS style
    sheet to TARGET-DIR, as well. Example usage:
    
    ```commonlisp
    (update-asdf-system-html-docs @mgl-pax-manual :mgl-pax)
    ```
    
    The same, linking to the sources on github:
    
    ```commonlisp
    (update-asdf-system-html-docs
      @mgl-pax-manual :mgl-pax
      :pages
      `((:objects
        (,mgl-pax:@mgl-pax-manual)
        :source-uri-fn ,(make-github-source-uri-fn
                         :mgl-pax
                         "https://github.com/melisgl/mgl-pax"))))
    ```


- [variable] *DOCUMENT-HTML-MAX-NAVIGATION-TABLE-OF-CONTENTS-LEVEL* NIL

    NIL or a non-negative integer. If non-NIL, it overrides
    *DOCUMENT-MAX-NUMBERING-LEVEL* in dynamic HTML table of contents on
    the left of the page.

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-HTML-TOP-BLOCKS-OF-LINKS* NIL

    A list of blocks of links to be display on the sidebar on the left,
    above the table of contents. A block is of the form `(&KEY TITLE ID
    LINKS)`, where TITLE will be displayed at the top of the block in a
    HTML `DIV` with `ID`, followed by the links. LINKS is a list
    of `(URI LABEL) elements.`

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-HTML-BOTTOM-BLOCKS-OF-LINKS* NIL

    Like *DOCUMENT-HTML-TOP-BLOCKS-OF-LINKS*, only it is displayed
    below the table of contents.

#### Github Workflow

It is generally recommended to commit generated readmes (see
UPDATE-ASDF-SYSTEM-READMES) so that users have something to read
without reading the code and sites like github can display them.

HTML documentation can also be committed, but there is an issue with
that: when linking to the sources (see MAKE-GITHUB-SOURCE-URI-FN),
the commit id is in the link. This means that code changes need to
be committed first, then HTML documentation regenerated and
committed in a followup commit.

The second issue is that github is not very good at serving HTMLs
files from the repository itself (and
[http://htmlpreview.github.io](http://htmlpreview.github.io) chokes
on links to the sources).

The recommended workflow is to use
[gh-pages](https://pages.github.com/), which can be made relatively
painless with the `git workflow` command. The gist of it is to make
the `doc/` directory a checkout of the branch named `gh-pages`. A
good description of this process is
[http://sangsoonam.github.io/2019/02/08/using-git-worktree-to-deploy-github-pages.html](http://sangsoonam.github.io/2019/02/08/using-git-worktree-to-deploy-github-pages.html).
Two commits needed still, but it is somewhat less painful.

This way the HTML documentation will be available at
`http://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>`. It is probably a good
idea to add section like the @MGL-PAX-LINKS section to allow jumping
between the repository and the gh-pages site.

- [function] MAKE-GITHUB-SOURCE-URI-FN ASDF-SYSTEM GITHUB-URI &KEY GIT-VERSION

    Return a function suitable as :SOURCE-URI-FN of a page spec (see
    the PAGES argument of DOCUMENT). The function looks the source
    location of the reference passed to it, and if the location is
    found, the path is made relative to the root directory of
    ASDF-SYSTEM and finally an URI pointing to github is returned. The
    URI looks like this:
    
        https://github.com/melisgl/mgl-pax/blob/master/src/pax-early.lisp#L12
    
    "master" in the above link comes from GIT-VERSION.
    
    If GIT-VERSION is NIL, then an attempt is made to determine to
    current commit id from the `.git` in the directory holding
    ASDF-SYSTEM. If no `.git` directory is found, then no links to
    github will be generated.
    
    A separate warning is signalled whenever source location lookup
    fails or if the source location points to a directory not below the
    directory of ASDF-SYSTEM.

#### PAX World

PAX World is a registry of documents, which can generate
cross-linked HTML documentation pages for all the registered
documents.

- [function] REGISTER-DOC-IN-PAX-WORLD NAME SECTIONS PAGE-SPECS

    Register SECTIONS and PAGE-SPECS under NAME in PAX World. By
    default, UPDATE-PAX-WORLD generates documentation for all of these.

For example, this is how PAX registers itself:

```commonlisp
(defun pax-sections ()
  (list @mgl-pax-manual))
(defun pax-pages ()
  `((:objects
     (,mgl-pax:@mgl-pax-manual)
     :source-uri-fn ,(make-github-source-uri-fn
                      :mgl-pax
                      "https://github.com/melisgl/mgl-pax"))))
(register-doc-in-pax-world :mgl-pax (pax-sections) (pax-pages))
```

- [function] UPDATE-PAX-WORLD &KEY (DOCS \*REGISTERED-PAX-WORLD-DOCS\*) DIR

    Generate HTML documentation for all DOCS. By default, files are
    created in *PAX-WORLD-DIR* or `(asdf:system-relative-pathname
    :mgl-pax "world/")`, if NIL. DOCS is a list of entries of the
    form (NAME SECTIONS PAGE-SPECS). The default for DOCS is all the
    sections and pages registered with REGISTER-DOC-IN-PAX-WORLD.
    
    In the absence of :HEADER-FN :FOOTER-FN, :OUTPUT, every spec in
    PAGE-SPECS is augmented with HTML headers, footers and output
    location specifications (based on the name of the section).
    
    If necessary a default page spec is created for every section.

- [variable] *PAX-WORLD-DIR* NIL

    The default location to which to write the generated documentation.
    If NIL it defaults to:
    
    ```commonlisp
    (asdf:system-relative-pathname :mgl-pax "world/")
    ```


### Document Generation Implementation Notes

Documentation Generation is supported on ABCL, AllegroCL, CLISP,
CCL, CMUCL, ECL and SBCL, but their outputs may differ due to the
lack of some introspective capability. SBCL generates complete
output. Compared to that, the following are not supported:

- COMPILER-MACRO docstrings on ABCL, AllegroCL, CCL, ECL,

- DEFTYPE lambda lists on ABCL, AllegroCL, CLISP, CCL, CMUCL, ECL,

- default values in MACRO lambda lists on AllegroCL,

- default values in function lambda lists on CCL (needs `(DEBUG 3)`
  on AllegroCL),

- METHOD-COMBINATION docstrings on ABCL, AllegroCL.


## Transcripts

What are transcripts for? When writing a tutorial, one often wants
to include a REPL session with maybe a few defuns and a couple of
forms whose output or return values are shown. Also, in a function's
docstring an example call with concrete arguments and return values
speaks volumes. A transcript is a text that looks like a repl
session, but which has a light markup for printed output and return
values, while no markup (i.e. prompt) for Lisp forms. PAX
transcripts may include output and return values of all forms, or
only selected ones. In either case, the transcript itself can be
easily generated from the source code.

The main worry associated with including examples in the
documentation is that they tend to get out-of-sync with the code.
This is solved by being able to parse back and update transcripts.
In fact, this is exactly what happens during documentation
generation with PAX. Code sections tagged `cl-transcript` are
retranscribed and checked for inconsistency (that is, any difference
in output or return values). If the consistency check fails, an
error is signalled that includes a reference to the object being
documented.

Going beyond documentation, transcript consistency checks can be
used for writing simple tests in a very readable form. For example:

```common-lisp
(+ 1 2)
=> 3

(values (princ :hello) (list 1 2))
.. HELLO
=> :HELLO
=> (1 2)
```

All in all, transcripts are a handy tool especially when combined
with the Emacs support to regenerate them and with
PYTHONIC-STRING-READER's triple-quoted strings, that allow one to
work with nested strings with less noise. The triple-quote syntax
can be enabled with:

    (in-readtable pythonic-string-syntax)


### MGL-PAX/TRANSCRIBE ASDF System Details

- Description: Transcription support for MGL-PAX.
- Long Description: Autoloaded by MGL-PAX:TRANSCRIBE and by the Emacs
  integration (see MGL-PAX:@MGL-PAX-TRANSCRIPTS).
- Licence: MIT, see COPYING.
- Author: Gábor Melis
- Mailto: [mega@retes.hu](mailto:mega@retes.hu)


### Transcribing with Emacs

Typical transcript usage from within Emacs is simple: add a lisp
form to a docstring or comment at any indentation level. Move the
cursor right after the end of the form as if you were to evaluate it
with `C-x C-e`. The cursor is marked by `#\^`:

    This is part of a docstring.
    
    ```cl-transcript
    (values (princ :hello) (list 1 2))^
    ```

Note that the use of fenced code blocks with the language tag
`cl-transcript` is only to tell PAX to perform consistency checks at
documentation generation time.

Now invoke the elisp function `mgl-pax-transcribe` where the cursor
is and the fenced code block from the docstring becomes:

    (values (princ :hello) (list 1 2))
    .. HELLO
    => :HELLO
    => (1 2)
    ^

Then you change the printed message and add a comment to the second
return value:

    (values (princ :hello-world) (list 1 2))
    .. HELLO
    => :HELLO
    => (1
        ;; This value is arbitrary.
        2)

When generating the documentation you get a
TRANSCRIPTION-CONSISTENCY-ERROR because the printed output and the
first return value changed so you regenerate the documentation by
marking the region of bounded by `#\|` and the cursor at `#\^` in
the example:

    |(values (princ :hello-world) (list 1 2))
    .. HELLO
    => :HELLO
    => (1
        ;; This value is arbitrary.
        2)
    ^

then invoke the elisp function `mgl-pax-retranscribe-region` to get:

    (values (princ :hello-world) (list 1 2))
    .. HELLO-WORLD
    => :HELLO-WORLD
    => (1
        ;; This value is arbitrary.
        2)
    ^

Note how the indentation and the comment of `(1 2)` was left alone
but the output and the first return value got updated.

Alternatively, `C-u 1 mgl-pax-transcribe` will emit commented markup:

    (values (princ :hello) (list 1 2))
    ;.. HELLO
    ;=> :HELLO
    ;=> (1 2)

`C-u 0 mgl-pax-retranscribe-region` will turn commented into
non-commented markup. In general, the numeric prefix argument is the
index of the syntax to be used in MGL-PAX:*TRANSCRIBE-SYNTAXES*.
Without a prefix argument `mgl-pax-retranscribe-region` will not
change the markup style.

Finally, not only do both functions work at any indentation level,
but in comments too:

    ;;;; (values (princ :hello) (list 1 2))
    ;;;; .. HELLO
    ;;;; => :HELLO
    ;;;; => (1 2)

Transcription support in emacs can be enabled by loading
`src/transcribe.el`.

### Transcript API

- [function] TRANSCRIBE INPUT OUTPUT &KEY UPDATE-ONLY (INCLUDE-NO-OUTPUT UPDATE-ONLY) (INCLUDE-NO-VALUE UPDATE-ONLY) (ECHO T) (CHECK-CONSISTENCY \*TRANSCRIBE-CHECK-CONSISTENCY\*) DEFAULT-SYNTAX (INPUT-SYNTAXES \*TRANSCRIBE-SYNTAXES\*) (OUTPUT-SYNTAXES \*TRANSCRIBE-SYNTAXES\*)

    Read forms from INPUT and write them (iff ECHO) to OUTPUT
    followed by any output and return values produced by calling EVAL on
    the form. INPUT can be a stream or a string, while OUTPUT can be a
    stream or NIL in which case transcription goes into a string. The
    return value is the OUTPUT stream or the string that was
    constructed.
    
    A simple example is this:
    
    ```common-lisp
    (transcribe "(princ 42) " nil)
    => "(princ 42)
    .. 42
    => 42
    "
    ```
    
    However, the above may be a bit confusing since this documentation
    uses TRANSCRIBE markup syntax in this very example, so let's do it
    differently. If we have a file with these contents:
    
    ```commonlisp
    (values (princ 42) (list 1 2))
    ```
    
    it is transcribed to:
    
    ```commonlisp
    (values (princ 42) (list 1 2))
    .. 42
    => 42
    => (1 2)
    ```
    
    Output to all standard streams is captured and printed with
    the :OUTPUT prefix (`".."`). The return values above are printed
    with the :READABLE prefix (`"=>"`). Note how these prefixes are
    always printed on a new line to facilitate parsing.
    
    **Updating**
    
    TRANSCRIBE is able to parse its own output. If we transcribe the
    previous output above, we get it back exactly. However, if we remove
    all output markers, leave only a placeholder value marker and
    pass :UPDATE-ONLY T with source:
    
    ```commonlisp
    (values (princ 42) (list 1 2))
    =>
    ```
    
    we get this:
    
    ```commonlisp
    (values (princ 42) (list 1 2))
    => 42
    => (1 2)
    ```
    
    With UPDATE-ONLY, the printed output of a form is only transcribed
    if there were output markers in the source. Similarly, with
    UPDATE-ONLY, return values are only transcribed if there were value
    markers in the source.
    
    **No Output/Values**
    
    If the form produces no output or returns no values, then whether or
    not output and values are transcribed is controlled by
    INCLUDE-NO-OUTPUT and INCLUDE-NO-VALUE, respectively. By default,
    neither is on so:
    
    ```commonlisp
    (values)
    ..
    =>
    ```
    
    is transcribed to
    
    ```commonlisp
    (values)
    ```
    
    With UPDATE-ONLY true, we probably wouldn't like to lose those
    markers since they were put there for a reason. Hence, with
    UPDATE-ONLY, INCLUDE-NO-OUTPUT and INCLUDE-NO-VALUE default to true.
    So with UPDATE-ONLY the above example is transcribed to:
    
    ```commonlisp
    (values)
    ..
    => ; No value
    ```
    
    where the last line is the :NO-VALUE prefix.
    
    **Consistency Checks**
    
    If CHECK-CONSISTENCY is true, then TRANSCRIBE signals a continuable
    TRANSCRIPTION-OUTPUT-CONSISTENCY-ERROR whenever a form's output as a
    string is different from what was in INPUT, provided that INPUT
    contained the output. Similary, for values, a continuable
    TRANSCRIPTION-VALUES-CONSISTENCY-ERROR is signalled if a value read
    from the source does not print as the as the value returned by EVAL.
    This allows readable values to be hand-indented without failing
    consistency checks:
    
    ```commonlisp
    (list 1 2)
    => ;; This is commented, too.
       (1
          ;; Funny indent.
          2)
    ```
    
    See @MGL-PAX-TRANSCRIPT-CONISTENCY-CHECKING for the full picture.
    
    **Unreadable Values**
    
    The above scheme involves READ, so consistency of unreadable values
    cannot be treated the same. In fact, unreadable values must even be
    printed differently for transcribe to be able to read them back:
    
    ```commonlisp
    (defclass some-class () ())
    
    (defmethod print-object ((obj some-class) stream)
      (print-unreadable-object (obj stream :type t)
        (format stream \"~%~%end\")))
    
    (make-instance 'some-class)
    ==> #<SOME-CLASS 
    -->
    --> end>
    ```
    
    where `"==>"` is the :UNREADABLE prefix and `"-->"` is the
    :UNREADABLE-CONTINUATION prefix. As with outputs, a consistency
    check between an unreadable value from the source and the value from
    EVAL is performed with STRING= by default. That is, the value from
    EVAL is printed to a string and compared to the source value. Hence,
    any change to unreadable values will break consistency checks. This
    is most troublesome with instances of classes with the default
    PRINT-OBJECT method printing the memory address. See @ no remedy for
    that, except for customizing PRINT-OBJECT or not transcribing that
    kind of stuff.
    
    **Errors**
    
    If an ERROR condition is signalled, the error is printed to the
    output and no values are returned.
    
    ```common-lisp
    (progn
      (print "hello")
      (error "no greeting"))
    ..
    .. "hello" 
    .. debugger invoked on SIMPLE-ERROR:
    ..   no greeting
    ```
    
    To keep the textual representation somewhat likely to be portable,
    the printing is done with `(FORMAT T "#<~S ~S>" (TYPE-OF
    ERROR) (PRINC-TO-STRING ERROR))`. SIMPLE-CONDITIONs are formatted to
    strings with SIMPLE-CONDITION-FORMAT-CONTROL and
    SIMPLE-CONDITION-FORMAT-ARGUMENTS.
    
    **Syntaxes**
    
    Finally, a transcript may employ different syntaxes for the output
    and values of different forms. When INPUT is read, the syntax for
    each form is determined by trying to match all prefixes from all
    syntaxes in INPUT-SYNTAXES against a line. If there are no output or
    values for a form in INPUT, then the syntax remains undetermined.
    
    When OUTPUT is written, the prefixes to be used are looked up in
    DEFAULT-SYNTAX of OUTPUT-SYNTAXES, if DEFAULT-SYNTAX is not NIL. If
    DEFAULT-SYNTAX is NIL, then the syntax used by the same form in the
    INPUT is used or (if that could not be determined) the syntax of the
    previous form. If there was no previous form, then the first syntax
    if OUTPUT-SYNTAXES is used.
    
    To produce a transcript that's executable Lisp code,
    use :DEFAULT-SYNTAX :COMMENTED-1:
    
    ```commonlisp
    (make-instance 'some-class)
    ;==> #<SOME-CLASS
    ;-->
    ;--> end>
    
    (list 1 2)
    ;=> (1
    ;->    2)
    ```
    
    To translate the above to uncommented syntax,
    use :DEFAULT-SYNTAX :DEFAULT. If DEFAULT-SYNTAX is NIL (the
    default), the same syntax will be used in the output as in the input
    as much as possible.

- [variable] *TRANSCRIBE-CHECK-CONSISTENCY* NIL

    The default value of TRANSCRIBE's CHECK-CONSISTENCY argument.

- [variable] *TRANSCRIBE-SYNTAXES* ((:DEFAULT (:OUTPUT "..") (:NO-VALUE "=\> ; No value") (:READABLE "=\>")
  (:UNREADABLE "==\>") (:UNREADABLE-CONTINUATION "--\>"))
 (:COMMENTED-1 (:OUTPUT ";..") (:NO-VALUE ";=\> ; No value")
  (:READABLE ";=\>") (:READABLE-CONTINUATION ";-\>") (:UNREADABLE ";==\>")
  (:UNREADABLE-CONTINUATION ";--\>"))
 (:COMMENTED-2 (:OUTPUT ";;..") (:NO-VALUE ";;=\> ; No value")
  (:READABLE ";;=\>") (:READABLE-CONTINUATION ";;-\>")
  (:UNREADABLE ";;==\>") (:UNREADABLE-CONTINUATION ";;--\>")))

    The default syntaxes used by TRANSCRIBE for reading and writing
    lines containing output and values of an evaluated form.
    
    A syntax is a list of of the form `(SYNTAX-ID &REST PREFIXES)` where
    `PREFIXES` is a list of `(PREFIX-ID PREFIX-STRING)` elements. For
    example the syntax :COMMENTED-1 looks like this:
    
    ```commonlisp
    (:commented-1
     (:output ";..")
     (:no-value ";=>  No value")
     (:readable ";=>")
     (:readable-continuation ";->")
     (:unreadable ";==>")
     (:unreadable-continuation ";-->"))
    ```
    
    All of the above prefixes must be defined for every syntax except
    for :READABLE-CONTINUATION. If that's missing (as in the :DEFAULT
    syntax), then the following value is read with READ and printed with
    PRIN1 (hence no need to mark up the following lines).
    
    When writing, an extra space is added automatically if the line to
    be prefixed is not empty. Similarly, the first space following the
    prefix is discarded when reading.
    
    See TRANSCRIBE for how the actual syntax to be used is selected.

- [condition] TRANSCRIPTION-ERROR ERROR

    Represents syntactic errors in the SOURCE argument
    of TRANSCRIBE and also serves as the superclass of
    TRANSCRIPTION-CONSISTENCY-ERROR.

- [condition] TRANSCRIPTION-CONSISTENCY-ERROR TRANSCRIPTION-ERROR

    A common superclass for
    TRANSCRIPTION-OUTPUT-CONSISTENCY-ERROR and
    TRANSCRIPTION-VALUES-CONSISTENCY-ERROR.

- [condition] TRANSCRIPTION-OUTPUT-CONSISTENCY-ERROR TRANSCRIPTION-CONSISTENCY-ERROR

    Signaled (with CERROR) by TRANSCRIBE when invoked
    with :CHECK-CONSISTENCY and the output of a form is not the same as
    what was parsed.

- [condition] TRANSCRIPTION-VALUES-CONSISTENCY-ERROR TRANSCRIPTION-CONSISTENCY-ERROR

    Signaled (with CERROR) by TRANSCRIBE when invoked
    with :CHECK-CONSISTENCY and the values of a form are inconsistent
    with their parsed representation.

### Transcript Consistency Checking

The main use case for consistency checking is detecting
out-of-date examples in documentation, although using it for writing
tests is also a possiblity. Here, we focus on the former.

When a markdown code block tagged `cl-transcript` is processed
during @MGL-PAX-GENERATING-DOCUMENTATION, the code in it is replaced
with the output of with `(TRANSCRIBE <CODE> NIL :UPDATE-ONLY T
:CHECK-CONSISTENCY T)`. Suppose we have the following example of the
function `GREET`, that prints `hello` and returns 7.

    ```cl-transcript
    (greet)
    .. hello
    => 7
    ```

Now, if we change `GREET` to print or return something else, a
TRANSCRIPTION-CONSISTENCY-ERROR will be signalled during
documentation generation. Then we may fix the documentation or
[CONTINUE][restart] from the error.

By default, comparisons of previous to current ouput, readable and
unreadable return values are performed with STRING=, EQUAL, and
STRING=, respectively, which is great in the simple case.
Non-determinism aside, exact matching becomes brittle as soon as the
notoriously unportable pretty printer is used or when unreadable
objects are printed with their `#<>` syntax, especially when
PRINT-UNREADABLE-OBJECT is used with `:IDENTITY T`.

#### Finer-grained Consistency Checks

To get around this problem, consistency checking of output,
readable and unreadable values can be customized individually by
supplying TRANSCRIBE with a CHECK-CONSISTENCY argument
like `((:OUTPUT <OUTPUT-CHECK>) (:READABLE
<READABLE-CHECK>) (:UNREADABLE <UNREADABLE-CHECK>))`. In this case,
`<OUTPUT-CHECK>` may be NIL, T, or a function designator.

- If it's NIL or there is no :OUTPUT entry in the list, then the
  output is not checked for consistency.

- If it's T, then the outputs are compared with the default,
  STRING=.

- If it's a function designator, then it's called with two strings
  and must return whether they are consistent with each other.

The case of `<READABLE-CHECK>` and `<UNREADABLE-CHECK>` is similar.

Code blocks tagged `cl-transcript` can take arguments, which they
pass on to TRANSCRIBE. The following shows how to check only the
output.

    ```cl-transcript (:check-consistency ((:output t)))
    (error "Oh, no.")
    .. debugger invoked on SIMPLE-ERROR:
    ..   Oh, no.
    
    (make-condition 'simple-error)
    ==> #<SIMPLE-ERROR {1008A81533}>


#### Controlling the Dynamic Environment

The dynamic enviroment in which forms in the transcript are
evaluated can be controlled via the :DYNENV argument of
`cl-transcript`.

    ```cl-transcript (:dynenv my-transcript)
    ...
    ```

In this case, instead of calling TRANSCRIBE directly, the call will
be wrapped in a function of no arguments and passed to the function
`MY-TRANSCRIPT`, which establishes the desired dynamic environment
and calls its argument. The following definition of `MY-TRANSCRIPT`
simply packages up oft-used settings to TRANSCRIBE.

```
(defun my-transcript (fn)
  (let ((*transcribe-check-consistency*
          '((:output my-transcript-output=)
            (:readable equal)
            (:unreadable nil))))
    (funcall fn)))

(defun my-transcript-output= (string1 string2)
  (string= (my-transcript-normalize-output string1)
           (my-transcript-normalize-output string2)))

(defun my-transcript-normalize-output (string)
  (squeeze-whitespace (delete-trailing-whitespace (delete-comments string))))
```

A more involved solution could rebind global variables set in
transcripts, unintern symbols created or even create a temporary
package for evaluation.

#### Utilities for Consistency Checking

- [function] SQUEEZE-WHITESPACE STRING

    Replace consecutive whitespace characters with a single space in
    STRING. This is useful to do undo the effects of pretty printing
    when building comparison functions for TRANSCRIBE.

- [function] DELETE-TRAILING-WHITESPACE STRING

    Delete whitespace characters after the last non-whitespace
    character in each line in STRING.

- [function] DELETE-COMMENTS STRING &KEY (PATTERN ";")

    For each line in STRING delete the rest of the line after and
    including the first occurrence of PATTERN. On changed lines, delete
    trailing whitespace too. Let's define a comparison function:
    
    ```common-lisp
    (defun string=/no-comments (string1 string2)
      (string= (delete-comments string1) (delete-comments string2)))
    ```
    
    And use it to check consistency of output:
    
        ```cl-transcript (:check-consistency ((:output string=/no-comments)))
        (format t "hello~%world")
        .. hello     ; This is the first line.
        .. world     ; This is the second line.
        ```
    
    Just to make sure the above example works, here it is without the being
    quoted.
    
    ```common-lisp
    (format t "hello~%world")
    .. hello     ; This is the first line.
    .. world     ; This is the second line.
    ```


## Extension API

### Locatives and References API

`(MAKE-REFERENCE 'FOO 'VARIABLE)` constructs a REFERENCE that
captures the path to take from an object (the symbol FOO) to an
entity of interest (for example, the documentation of the variable).
The path is called the locative. A locative can be applied to an
object like this:

```
(locate 'foo 'variable)
```

which will return the same reference as `(MAKE-REFERENCE 'FOO
'VARIABLE)`. Operations need to know how to deal with references,
which we will see in LOCATE-AND-COLLECT-REACHABLE-OBJECTS,
LOCATE-AND-DOCUMENT and LOCATE-AND-FIND-SOURCE.

Naturally, `(LOCATE 'FOO 'FUNCTION)` will simply return `#'FOO`, no
need to muck with references when there is a perfectly good object.

- [function] LOCATE OBJECT LOCATIVE &KEY (ERRORP T)

    Follow LOCATIVE from OBJECT and return the object it leads to or a
    REFERENCE if there is no first class object corresponding to the
    location. If ERRORP, then a LOCATE-ERROR condition is signaled when
    the lookup fails.

- [condition] LOCATE-ERROR ERROR

    Signaled by LOCATE when the lookup fails and ERRORP
    is true.

- [reader] LOCATE-ERROR-MESSAGE LOCATE-ERROR (:MESSAGE)

- [reader] LOCATE-ERROR-OBJECT LOCATE-ERROR (:OBJECT)

- [reader] LOCATE-ERROR-LOCATIVE LOCATE-ERROR (:LOCATIVE)

- [function] RESOLVE REFERENCE &KEY (ERRORP T)

    A convenience function to LOCATE REFERENCE's object with its
    locative.

- [class] REFERENCE

    A REFERENCE represents a path (REFERENCE-LOCATIVE)
    to take from an object (REFERENCE-OBJECT).

- [reader] REFERENCE-OBJECT REFERENCE (:OBJECT)

- [reader] REFERENCE-LOCATIVE REFERENCE (:LOCATIVE)

- [function] MAKE-REFERENCE OBJECT LOCATIVE

- [function] LOCATIVE-TYPE LOCATIVE

    The first element of LOCATIVE if it's a list. If it's a symbol then
    it's that symbol itself. Typically, methods of generic functions
    working with locatives take locative type and locative args as
    separate arguments to allow methods have eql specializers on the
    type symbol.

- [function] LOCATIVE-ARGS LOCATIVE

    The REST of LOCATIVE if it's a list. If it's a symbol then
    it's ().

### Adding New Object Types

One may wish to make the DOCUMENT function and `M-.` navigation
work with new object types. Extending DOCUMENT can be done by
defining a DOCUMENT-OBJECT method. To allow these objects to be
referenced from DEFSECTION, a LOCATE-OBJECT method is to be defined.
For `M-.` FIND-SOURCE can be specialized. Finally,
EXPORTABLE-LOCATIVE-TYPE-P may be overridden if exporting does not
makes sense. Here is a stripped down example of how all this is done
for ASDF:SYSTEM:

```commonlisp
(define-locative-type asdf:system ()
  "Refers to an asdf system. The generated documentation will include
  meta information extracted from the system definition. This also
  serves as an example of a symbol that's not accessible in the
  current package and consequently is not exported.

  ASDF:SYSTEM is not EXPORTABLE-LOCATIVE-TYPE-P.")

(defmethod locate-object (name (locative-type (eql 'asdf:system))
                          locative-args)
  (or (and (endp locative-args)
           ;; FIXME: This is slow as hell.
           (asdf:find-system (string-downcase (string name)) nil))
      (locate-error "~S does not name an asdf system." name)))

(defmethod canonical-reference ((system asdf:system))
  (make-reference (character-string (slot-value system 'asdf::name))
                  'asdf:system))

;;; For testing
(defvar *omit-asdf-slots* nil)

(defmethod document-object ((system asdf:system) stream)
  (with-heading (stream system
                        (format nil "~A ASDF System Details"
                                (string-upcase
                                 (slot-value system 'asdf::name))))
    (flet ((foo (name fn &key type)
             (let ((value (funcall fn system)))

(add-locative-to-source-search-list 'asdf:system)

```

- [macro] DEFINE-LOCATIVE-TYPE LOCATIVE-TYPE LAMBDA-LIST &BODY DOCSTRING

    Declare LOCATIVE-TYPE as a [LOCATIVE][locative]. One gets two
    things in return: first, a place to document the format and
    semantics of LOCATIVE-TYPE (in LAMBDA-LIST and DOCSTRING); second,
    being able to reference `(LOCATIVE-TYPE LOCATIVE)`. For example, if
    you have:
    
    ```common-lisp
    (define-locative-type variable (&optional initform)
      "Dummy docstring.")
    ```
    
    then `(VARIABLE LOCATIVE)` refers to this form.

- [macro] DEFINE-LOCATIVE-ALIAS ALIAS LOCATIVE-TYPE

    Define ALIAS as a locative equivalent to LOCATIVE-TYPE (both
    SYMBOLs). The following example shows how to make docstrings read
    more naturally by defining an alias.
    
    ```common-lisp
    (defclass my-string ()
      ())
    
    (defgeneric my-string (obj)
      (:documentation "Convert OBJ to MY-STRING."))
    
    ;;; This version of FOO has a harder to read docstring because
    ;;; it needs to disambiguate the MY-STRING reference.
    (defun foo (x)
      "FOO takes and argument X, a [MY-STRING][class] object.")
    
    ;;; Define OBJECT as an alias for the CLASS locative.
    (define-locative-alias object class)
    
    ;;; Note how no explicit link is needed anymore.
    (defun foo (x)
      "FOO takes an argument X, a MY-CLASS object.")
    ```


- [generic-function] EXPORTABLE-LOCATIVE-TYPE-P LOCATIVE-TYPE

    Return true iff symbols in references with
    LOCATIVE-TYPE are to be exported by default when they occur in a
    DEFSECTION. The default method returns T, while the methods for
    PACKAGE, ASDF:SYSTEM and METHOD return NIL.
    
    DEFSECTION calls this function to decide what symbols to export when
    its EXPORT argument is true.

- [generic-function] LOCATE-OBJECT OBJECT LOCATIVE-TYPE LOCATIVE-ARGS

    Return the object to which OBJECT and the locative
    refer. For example, if LOCATIVE-TYPE is the symbol
    PACKAGE, this returns `(FIND-PACKAGE SYMBOL)`. Signal
    a LOCATE-ERROR condition by calling the LOCATE-ERROR function if the
    lookup fails. Signal other errors if the types of the argument are
    bad, for instance LOCATIVE-ARGS is not the empty list in the package
    example. If a REFERENCE is returned then it must be canonical in the
    sense that calling CANONICAL-REFERENCE on it will return the same
    reference. For extension only, don't call this directly.

- [function] LOCATE-ERROR &REST FORMAT-AND-ARGS

    Call this function to signal a LOCATE-ERROR condition from a
    LOCATE-OBJECT method. FORMAT-AND-ARGS contains a format string and
    args suitable for FORMAT from which the LOCATE-ERROR-MESSAGE is
    constructed. If FORMAT-AND-ARGS is NIL, then the message will be NIL
    too.
    
    The object and the locative are not specified, they are added by
    LOCATE when it resignals the condition.

- [generic-function] CANONICAL-REFERENCE OBJECT

    Return a REFERENCE that resolves to OBJECT.
    
    If OBJECT is a REFERENCE, then:
    
    - if it can be `RESOLVE`d, CANONICAL-REFERENCE is called on the
      resolved object,
    
    - else, an equivalent reference is returned.


- [generic-function] COLLECT-REACHABLE-OBJECTS OBJECT

    Return a list of objects representing all things
    that would be documented in a (DOCUMENT OBJECT) call. For SECTIONS
    this is simply the union of references reachable from references in
    SECTION-ENTRIES. The returned objects can be anything provided that
    CANONICAL-REFERENCE works on them. The list need not include OBJECT
    itself.
    
    One only has to specialize this for new container-like objects.

- [method] COLLECT-REACHABLE-OBJECTS OBJECT

    This default implementation returns the empty list. This means that
    nothing is reachable from OBJECT.

- [variable] *FORMAT* 

    Bound by DOCUMENT, this allows markdown output to depend on the
    output format.

- [generic-function] DOCUMENT-OBJECT OBJECT STREAM

    Write OBJECT (and its references recursively) in
    *FORMAT* to STREAM.
    
    Add methods specializing on OBJECT to customize how objects of that
    type are presented in the documentation.

- [method] DOCUMENT-OBJECT (STRING STRING) STREAM

    Print STRING verbatim to STREAM after cleaning up indentation.
    
    Docstrings in sources are indented in various ways, which can easily
    mess up markdown. To handle the most common cases leave, the first
    line alone but from the rest of the lines strip the longest run of
    leading spaces that is common to all non-blank lines.

- [generic-function] FIND-SOURCE OBJECT

    Return the Swank source location for OBJECT. It
    is called by LOCATE-DEFINITIONS-FOR-EMACS, which lies behind the
    `M-.` extension (see @MGL-PAX-NAVIGATING-IN-EMACS).
    
    If successful, the return value should look like one of these:
    
    ```commonlisp
    (:LOCATION
      (:FILE "/home/melisgl/own/mgl-pax/src/pax.lisp")
      (:POSITION 3303) NIL)
    (:LOCATION
      (:FILE "/home/melisgl/own/mgl-pax/src/pax.lisp")
      (:OFFSET 1 3303) NIL)
    (:LOCATION
      (:FILE "/home/melisgl/own/mgl-pax/src/pax.lisp")
      (:FUNCTION-NAME "FOO") NIL)
    ```
    
    The NIL above is the source snippet, which is optional. Note that
    position 1 is the first character in `:FILE`. If unsuccessful, the
    return value is like:
    
    ```commonlisp
    (:error "Unknown source location for SOMETHING")
    ```


### Reference Based Extensions

Let's see how to extend DOCUMENT and `M-.` navigation if there is
no first class object to represent the thing of interest. Recall
that LOCATE returns a REFERENCE object in this case. DOCUMENT-OBJECT
and FIND-SOURCE defer to LOCATE-AND-DOCUMENT and
LOCATE-AND-FIND-SOURCE, which have LOCATIVE-TYPE in their argument
list for [EQL][type] specializing pleasure. Here is a stripped down
example of how the VARIABLE locative is defined:

```commonlisp
(define-locative-type variable (&optional initform)
  """Refers to a global special variable. INITFORM, or if not specified,
  the global value of the variable is included in the documentation.

  ```
  ;;; A REFERENCE is returned because there is no such type as VARIABLE.
  (locate '*FORMAT* 'variable)
  ==> #<REFERENCE *FORMAT* VARIABLE>
  ```

  For the output of `(DOCUMENT (MAKE-REFERENCE '*FORMAT* 'VARIABLE))`,
  see *FORMAT*. Note that *FORMAT* is unbound. If the variable is
  BOUNDP, then its _current_ value is included in the documentation.
  See *DOCUMENT-LINK-CODE* for an example output. To override the
  current value, `INITFORM` may be provided. This is particulary
  useful if the value of the variable is something undesirable such as
  `#<MY-CLASS {100171ED93}>`.
  """)

(defmethod locate-object (symbol (locative-type (eql 'variable)) locative-args)
  (unless (<= (length locative-args) 1)
    (locate-error "The lambda list of the VARIABLE locative is ~
                   (&OPTIONAL INITFORM)."))
  (make-reference symbol (cons locative-type locative-args)))

(defmethod locate-and-document (symbol (locative-type (eql 'variable))
                                locative-args stream)
  (destructuring-bind (&optional (initform nil initformp)) locative-args
    (locate-and-print-bullet locative-type locative-args symbol stream)
    (write-char #\Space stream)
    (multiple-value-bind (value unboundp) (symbol-global-value symbol)
      (when (or initformp (not unboundp))
        (print-arglist (prin1-and-escape-markdown (if initformp
                                                      initform
                                                      value))
                       stream)))
    (print-end-bullet stream)
    (with-local-references ((list (make-reference symbol 'variable)))
      (maybe-print-docstring symbol locative-type stream))))

(defmethod locate-and-find-source (symbol (locative-type (eql 'variable))
                                   locative-args)
  (declare (ignore locative-args))
  (find-definition symbol (swank-variable-dspecs symbol)))

```

- [method] COLLECT-REACHABLE-OBJECTS (REFERENCE REFERENCE)

    If REFERENCE can be resolved to a non-reference, call
    COLLECT-REACHABLE-OBJECTS with it, else call
    LOCATE-AND-COLLECT-REACHABLE-OBJECTS on the object, locative-type,
    locative-args of REFERENCE

- [generic-function] LOCATE-AND-COLLECT-REACHABLE-OBJECTS OBJECT LOCATIVE-TYPE LOCATIVE-ARGS

    Called by COLLECT-REACHABLE-OBJECTS on REFERENCE
    objects, this function has essentially the same purpose as its
    caller but it has different arguments to allow specializing on
    LOCATIVE-TYPE.

- [method] LOCATE-AND-COLLECT-REACHABLE-OBJECTS OBJECT LOCATIVE-TYPE LOCATIVE-ARGS

    This default implementation returns the empty list. This means that
    nothing is reachable from the reference.

- [method] DOCUMENT-OBJECT (REFERENCE REFERENCE) STREAM

    If REFERENCE can be resolved to a non-reference, call
    DOCUMENT-OBJECT with it, else call LOCATE-AND-DOCUMENT-OBJECT on the
    object, locative-type, locative-args of REFERENCE

- [generic-function] LOCATE-AND-DOCUMENT OBJECT LOCATIVE-TYPE LOCATIVE-ARGS STREAM

    Called by DOCUMENT-OBJECT on REFERENCE objects,
    this function has essentially the same purpose as DOCUMENT-OBJECT
    but it has different arguments to allow specializing on
    LOCATIVE-TYPE.

- [generic-function] LOCATE-AND-FIND-SOURCE OBJECT LOCATIVE-TYPE LOCATIVE-ARGS

    This function serves the same purpose as
    FIND-SOURCE, but it has different arguments to allow specializing on
    LOCATIVE-TYPE. Methods defined as extensions must be
    `EQL`-specialized on a particular locative type and return a Swank
    `location` as documented in FIND-SOURCE.
    
    See FIND-SOURCE `(method () (t))` and
    FIND-SOURCE `(method () (reference))` for a description of when this
    function is called. Don't call this function directly.

- [method] FIND-SOURCE OBJECT

    Call LOCATE-AND-FIND-SOURCE with the appropriate parts of
    CANONICAL-REFERENCE for OBJECT.

- [method] FIND-SOURCE (REFERENCE REFERENCE)

    Call LOCATE-AND-FIND-SOURCE with the appropriate parts of
    REFERENCE. If there is no method specialized on the [locative
    type][@mgl-pax-locatives-and-references], then attempt to RESOLVE
    REFERENCE to a non-`REFERENCE` object and invoke FIND-SOURCE on it.
    
    Thus for new locative types, only FIND-SOURCE or
    LOCATE-AND-FIND-SOURCE needs to be specialized.

We have covered the basic building blocks of reference based
extensions. Now let's see how the obscure
DEFINE-SYMBOL-LOCATIVE-TYPE and
DEFINE-DEFINER-FOR-SYMBOL-LOCATIVE-TYPE macros work together to
simplify the common task of associating definition and documentation
with symbols in a certain context.

- [macro] DEFINE-SYMBOL-LOCATIVE-TYPE LOCATIVE-TYPE LAMBDA-LIST &BODY DOCSTRING

    Similar to DEFINE-LOCATIVE-TYPE but it assumes that all things
    locatable with LOCATIVE-TYPE are going to be just symbols defined
    with a definer defined with DEFINE-DEFINER-FOR-SYMBOL-LOCATIVE-TYPE.
    It is useful to attach documentation and source location to symbols
    in a particular context. An example will make everything clear:
    
    ```commonlisp
    (define-symbol-locative-type direction ()
      "A direction is a symbol. (After this `M-.` on `DIRECTION LOCATIVE`
      works and it can also be included in DEFSECTION forms.)")
    
    (define-definer-for-symbol-locative-type define-direction direction
      "With DEFINE-DIRECTION one can document what a symbol means when
      interpreted as a direction.")
    
    (define-direction up ()
      "UP is equivalent to a coordinate delta of (0, -1).")
    ```
    
    After all this, `(UP DIRECTION)` refers to the `DEFINE-DIRECTION`
    form above.

- [macro] DEFINE-DEFINER-FOR-SYMBOL-LOCATIVE-TYPE NAME LOCATIVE-TYPE &BODY DOCSTRING

    Define a macro with NAME which can be used to attach documentation,
    a lambda-list and source location to a symbol in the context of
    LOCATIVE-TYPE. The defined macro's arglist is (SYMBOL LAMBDA-LIST
    &OPTIONAL DOCSTRING). LOCATIVE-TYPE is assumed to have been defined
    with DEFINE-SYMBOL-LOCATIVE-TYPE.

### Sections

[SECTION][class] objects rarely need to be dissected since
DEFSECTION and DOCUMENT cover most needs. However, it is plausible
that one wants to subclass them and maybe redefine how they are
presented.

- [class] SECTION

    DEFSECTION stores its NAME, TITLE, [PACKAGE][type],
    [READTABLE][type] and ENTRIES arguments in [SECTION][class]
    objects.

- [reader] SECTION-NAME SECTION (:NAME)

    The name of the global variable whose value is
    this SECTION object.

- [reader] SECTION-PACKAGE SECTION (:PACKAGE)

    *PACKAGE* will be bound to this package when
    generating documentation for this section if
    *DOCUMENT-NORMALIZE-PACKAGES*.

- [reader] SECTION-READTABLE SECTION (:READTABLE)

    *READTABLE* will be bound to this when generating
    documentation for this section if *DOCUMENT-NORMALIZE-PACKAGES*.

- [reader] SECTION-TITLE SECTION (:TITLE)

    A [STRING][type] or NIL. Used in generated
    documentation.

- [reader] SECTION-LINK-TITLE-TO SECTION (:LINK-TITLE-TO = NIL)

    A REFERENCE or NIL. Used in generated documentation.

- [reader] SECTION-ENTRIES SECTION (:ENTRIES)

    A list of strings and REFERENCE objects in the
    order they occurred in DEFSECTION.

- [method] DESCRIBE-OBJECT (SECTION SECTION) STREAM

    [SECTION][class] objects are printed by calling DOCUMENT on them
    with *DOCUMENT-NORMALIZE-PACKAGES* turned off to reduce clutter.
    This method is only defined if MGL-PAX/FULL is loaded to allow
    non-fancy descriptions to be printed when using CL:DESCRIBE.
